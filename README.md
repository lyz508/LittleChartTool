> A simple apllication for chart record

### Introduction
1. This application is built depends on the QT creator.
2. Can use the tab to switch between the button.
3. Will automatically renew the output.
4. Have a input error handle.
5. The first product when I am learning Qt design.
6. Have used the EVB to package an apllication.

### Operation
1. You can use the language type **set [file_path]** to set the dictionary file.
    - thee default file path is: *D:/chart_record/*
2. The critical character: '$', '&'
    - '$': this is use to specify the common chart
    - '&': this is use to specify the uncommon chart
3. Warninh: the application doesn't support the use of UTF-8 encoding, mind it!
